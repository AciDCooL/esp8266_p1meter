# ⚡ ESP8266 P1-METER ⚡ [v1.6.1 - 2026 PRO EDITION]

![WebUI Preview](assets/webui_preview.svg)

> "Industrial-grade stability for the modern smart home." 🛠️💊

This is a high-performance, ultra-stable P1 Meter firmware for the **Wemos D1 Mini / ESP8266**. Re-engineered from the ground up to eliminate common ESP8266 pitfalls like heap fragmentation, buffer overflows, and serial timing drifts.

---

## 🚀 KEY FEATURES

*   **🎯 INDUSTRIAL PRECISION (v1.5.7+):** Uses high-speed **Scaled Integers (x1000)** instead of slow software floats. Provides 100% accurate Voltage, Current, and Gas readings without CPU overhead.
*   **🛡️ BULLETPROOF BOOT v2 (v1.6.1):** UART initialization is delayed until the absolute end of setup. Automated hardware buffer purging ensures a clean start, preventing the "Stabilizing" lock.
*   **🔋 POWER STABILITY (v1.6.1):** Fixed brownout issues by implementing `WIFI_NONE_SLEEP` mode and spreading MQTT publishes with 50ms delays. This prevents the instantaneous power spikes that cause the "Power On" resets.
*   **🧠 ANTI-FRAG ENGINE:** Zero dynamic memory allocations (`String`/`vector`) in the main loop. Prevents "Swiss cheese" heap fragmentation, allowing for months of continuous uptime.
*   **🌐 24/7 BACKGROUND OTA:** Powered by **ElegantOTA v3**. The update portal at `/update` is always online and protected by HTTP Basic Auth.
*   **🏠 PRO HOME ASSISTANT INTEGRATION:** 
    *   **Dynamic Auto-Discovery:** Only registers the sensors your specific meter actually broadcasts.
    *   **Advanced Diagnostics:** Native reporting of MAC Address, Board Type, Firmware Version, and current MQTT Broker connection info.
*   **💾 RESILIENT STATE TRACKING:** 
    *   **RTC Persistence:** Critical totals (kWh/Gas) are stored in SRAM to survive soft-reboots.
    *   **Sanity Shield:** Discards physically impossible spikes (>10kWh/s) to keep your history clean.
    *   **Post-Mortem Reports:** Captures reset reasons and boot milestones for easy debugging over MQTT.

## 🔌 HARDWARE WIRING

Connect your ESP8266 to an RJ11 cable following these diagrams. 

### Standard Wiring (External Power)
Recommended for most setups. A 10K resistor is often required between 3.3V and the Data (RXD) pin for signal stability.

| P1 pin | ESP8266 Pin | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2 - RTS | 3.3v | Request to Send (Activates Port) |
| 3 - GND | GND | Ground |
| 5 - RXD | RX (GPIO3) | Data (10K pullup to 3.3V recommended) |

### Powered by Meter (DSMR 5.0+)
If your meter supports DSMR 5.0, it can power the ESP8266 directly via Pin 1 (Max 250mA).

| P1 pin | ESP8266 Pin | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 - 5V out | 5V / VIN | Power from Meter |
| 2 - RTS | 3.3v | Request to Send |
| 3 - GND | GND | Ground |
| 5 - RXD | RX (GPIO3) | Data |
| 6 - GND | GND | Ground |

## 📡 DIAGNOSTICS & TELEMETRY

The Pro Edition provides deep system visibility within Home Assistant:
- **IP & MAC Address:** Fast identification on your network.
- **Board Type:** Detects if you are running on a Wemos D1 Mini or NodeMCU.
- **MQTT Server:** Shows exactly which broker and port the device is currently connected to.
- **Uptime Stability:** LWT state machine transitions: `offline` ➔ `stabilizing` ➔ `online`.

## 🎮 INSTALLATION & BUILD

### Option 1: PlatformIO (Recommended)
1. Open the folder in **VS Code** with **PlatformIO**.
2. Click **Upload**. Dependencies are handled automatically.

### Option 2: Arduino IDE
1. Open `esp8266_p1meter/esp8266_p1meter.ino`.
2. Install libraries: `WiFiManager`, `PubSubClient`, `DoubleResetDetector`, `ArduinoJson` (**v7.0+**), `ElegantOTA` (**v3.1.0+**).
3. Connect your board and click **Upload**.
